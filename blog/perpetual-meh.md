## The Age of Meh: Why Are We So Dissatisfied (And Can We Fix It?)

Do you feel it too? That persistent, low-grade hum of dissatisfaction seems to be everywhere lately. Talk to friends, scroll through social media, catch the news – it often feels like collective morale is running on something empty. This something manifests as widespread exhaustion, a lack of enthusiasm or optimism, or just a feeling that people are navigating tough times without much energy or hope.

Perhaps this observation is skewed because I have friends who seem utterly disappointed with their lives, and I've lent them an ear (friends, just kidding... mostly! 😜). Honestly, most of the time, I'm very optimistic – so much so that my optimism sometimes sparks arguments (and maybe even a friendly fight or two). So, this post might seem out of character. But the feeling has been a common theme in recent conversations, and I felt compelled to just write it down.

Lets start with _Happiness_. Obviously a big word, but this is the underlying emotion that we are all trying to chase. Most of India is unhappy, so at least my conversations do not seem like an outlier. I think any happiness survey in any country will mostly show majority as unhappy. that is how humans are conditioned, we subconsciously chase unhappiness. The image below shows how happy (the happiness index) is India compared to other countries.

Where is this discontent coming from? Conversations often circle back to a few key areas:

1.  **Jobs:** Many my age, having already spent a decade in their industries, still feel their jobs are unfulfilling or underpaid. There's a constant pressure to do more, own more, benchmarked against those perceived as having "made it" – whether that's hitting a certain salary (X, where X is infinitely adjustable to whatever induces the max amount of sadness), landing a co-founder title, or achieving the nomadic traveler lifestyle that so many equate with fulfillment. On the contrary, the data says that this is the best time to be employed. The [unemployment rate is at an all time low since 1990s](https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/ind/india/unemployment-rate), there is a [19% increase in EPFO subscribers in FY24](https://www.republicworld.com/business/epfo-subscribers-grow-by-19-growth-to-165-crore-in-fy24), and [96% employers are already looking to ramp up their hiring](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/fresher/indias-job-market-set-for-a-hiring-surge-in-early-2025/articleshow/118606717.cms). Even though the data is optimistic, the on ground anecdotal evidence is starkly different.

2.  **Relationships:** This is often the age when companionship becomes a stronger focus. Yet, dissatisfaction seems common regardless of status. The unmarried cry about the lack of a partner, while married individuals feel burdened by their situation. Relationships are inherently complicated, of course. And I'm no expert to comment on this.

3.  **Society:** The broader world feels chaotic and uncertain – tariffs, trade wars, geopolitical conflicts, economic uncertainty, and more. And when this happens, you start questioning the point of everything around you. Things feel out of control. Say, there was a global economic collapse due to one of the things mentioned above, and you lost your job. Was it your fault? No. But does it affect your well being? Absolutely and Obviously Yes. Its a strange world to live in. On one hand you have these conflicts and tensions, while on the other the pace of technological progress is so astronomical that dystopia is definitely one of the outcomes, even [from the people developing it](https://www.gzeromedia.com/ai/be-very-scared-of-ai-social-media-in-politics). Any new AI breakthrough can make you obsolete tomorrow without warning. This isn't necessarily anyone's fault, but rather a reflection of the times.

An [interesting study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93464-6) done shows that uncertainty decreases happiness, and increases curiosity. Although the frame of the experiment was different, but the underlying idea can be extrapolated.

This raises a bigger question: Are we living in an age of perpetual 'meh', and is it affecting certain groups more than others? How did we arrive here? More importantly, can we genuinely feel *better*, or are we destined for a constant chase? Does society inherently reward this relentless pursuit? I recall happier childhood days and fun times with the same college friends. Same people, different prevailing emotions now. What changed?

### Unpacking the Roots: A Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

RCA! Such an analyst thing to do 😂. But anyway, let's try to diagnose this. While the feeling manifests differently for everyone, the root causes often fall into these categories:

* **The Never-Ending Pressure Cooker:** The drive to *do* more, *be* more, and *acquire* more feels relentless. It seems many are still "figuring things out" even after years with work experience. People talk about breaking free from conventional paths, but only a few manage it. Career ladders feel steeper, living costs (especially housing) are astronomical, and "hustle culture" breeds guilt for resting. So what's the solution? Become a farmer. I've seen my friends fantasize about escaping to a farm, growing vegetables, and living "peacefully" – note the emphasis on "peaceful". I can bet there is nothing peaceful about living in a village as a farmer, with the kind of lives we're used to. The never-ending pursuit can feel like a [hamster wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamster_wheel): run faster, get nowhere. This isn't necessarily a critique of hard work; hard work pushes boundaries. Most things around us are a result of relentless hard work. But it's crucial to pursue goals that bring personal joy, not just copy a life where the destination looks appealing, but the journey is soul-crushing.

* **Life Scripts for a Toss:** The traditional roadmap – school, college, stable career, marriage, house, retirement – feels outdated or unattainable for many. We might sketch out a life path early on, often influenced by societal and family expectations. But as we age and gain experience, that script often remains perpetually in "edit mode," never quite finalized or followed. We start asking, "What *now*?" We see the cracks in the conventional narrative and desire alternatives – less linear careers, different relationship models. This deviation can leave people feeling lost or like they're failing by not meeting outdated expectations.

* **The Social Media Comparison Trap:** We're constantly exposed to curated highlight reels: promotions, perfect weddings, exotic trips, flawless lives. This fuels FOMO and makes our reality feel inadequate. While many intellectually understand this and might deny being affected, the subconscious impact is real. [Studies consistently link heavy social media use to increased anxiety and depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10129173/). We compare our messy behind-the-scenes to others' polished public fronts – an inherently unfair comparison. Paradoxically, hyper-connectivity coincides with widespread feelings of isolation. Traditional family/community bonds have weakened, spontaneous local interactions are rarer, and much connection is screen-mediated. When was the last time you had a chat *just for the sake of it*? In a hustle-focused world, unpurposed conversation can feel like wasted time even with a friend, leading some to default to scrolling Instagram or watching YouTube clips instead of seeking genuine connection.

* **Information Overload & Anxiety:** We have unprecedented access to information. News travels instantly – a development in the US reaches India in seconds; a tech breakthrough is global news immediately. We're hyper-aware of global problems: political instability, economic downturns, climate change, and social injustices. While awareness is valuable, the constant bombardment of news, often negative, without a clear sense of action (What can I do?), can induce significant anxiety and helplessness.


### Was It Always This Way? Historical Perspective on Discontent

Romanticizing the past is easy, but historically, survival was the primary struggle for most: famine, disease, conflict, and lack of rights. Wait! Not that past!! Let's look at the 90s. *The graph below shows rising despair since the 90s*, it seems modern forms of dissatisfaction have intensified, even if historical hardships were different. Perhaps dissatisfaction existed then, too, overshadowed by a lack of modern triggers discussed above.

Can religion help? Maybe. But I found this Buddhist story insightful:
> *A Human says, "I want happiness". Buddha says, Remove 'I', that's ego. Remove "want", that's desire. And then you're left with happiness.*

Naval Ravikant offers a modern formula: Happiness = Reality - Expectations. He quoted this in [Joe Rogan's episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44), and maybe the original quote is not attributed to him. Perhaps lowering expectations, being present, and enjoying the moment is key. Easier said than done. Historically, perhaps limited information and fewer perceived options naturally constrained expectations, forcing an appreciation for what one had. Today, increased *visibility* and *articulation* of dissatisfaction, amplified by global communication and a culture of sharing, make these feelings more prominent.

### Hacking Happiness: Can We Engineer a Way Forward?

Okay, channeling my inner engineer: Can we "jugaad" our way to happiness? Find some hacks, even temporary ones? Perhaps. If dissatisfaction stems from the reality-desire gap, maybe the answer isn't just chasing *more*, but changing the game, primarily by reprogramming our expectations. Here are some thoughts, from systemic shifts to personal tweaks:

* **Beyond GDP: Prioritizing Well-being?** Some propose measuring national success by citizen happiness (like Bhutan's GNH) instead of just GDP, focusing policies on mental health, community, environment, and leisure. *My Take:* I strongly disagree, especially in contexts like India. It risks fostering weakness rather than resilience. True lasting happiness often comes not from ease, but from meaning, purpose, and overcoming challenges – the satisfaction of knowing you pushed yourself, even through difficulty. We need to embrace the uncertainty, and change the controllable. You only have so much to control.

* **Rethinking Work?** Ideas like four-day weeks or UBI are often floated. *My Take:* Again, I see these as potential BS – temporary band-aids addressing symptoms, not the root cause. As Naval Ravikant might put it, these are "No solutions to No problems." Investing in people to pursue meaningful work and education, perhaps through models inspired by venture capital, seems more promising than blanket handouts like UBI. I can write a separate blog post on this. If there is dissatisfaction around, something is causing it. So why not make it your work to try solving it? Gives more meaning, and a feeling of control and contentment.

* **Digital Boundaries & Tech Responsibility:** Managing our relationship with technology requires conscious effort, especially with platforms designed to maximize engagement, often leading to regret. Individual solutions like the [minimalist phone](https://www.minimalistphone.com/) exist. However, tech companies bear significant responsibility. Currently, many platforms optimize purely for metrics like screen time, clicks, views, etc. leading to attention-hijacking features over genuine value. What if they shifted focus? The objective function of these models can be value *after* use. One idea is algorithmic transparency – a fundamental shift from attention extraction to user value. [Zerodha's philosophy](https://zerodha.com/about/philosophy/) offers an interesting example in this direction.

* **Revitalizing Local Communities:** Addressing loneliness requires real-world connections. Simple, right? But again, easier said than done. Community centers, libraries, skill-sharing networks, co-housing projects, or simply making time for face-to-face interaction strengthen social bonds. This is where the government should step in. Nirmala Tai will then have some answers to why she needs more taxation!!.

* **Less Owning, More Being (and Learning):** Fleeting happiness can be bought – the thrill of a new gadget fades quickly. Lasting fulfillment often comes from experiences, learning, creativity, and contributing to something larger than oneself, rather than accumulating possessions. Education system can play a role here. Schools should encourage curiosity and big dreams, not stifle them. Evolving beyond standardized tests to prioritize critical thinking, emotional intelligence, adaptability, and navigating uncertainty equips individuals for a complex world far better than rote learning alone.

### What Now? Experimenting Our Way Forward

There's no magic bullet. Dissatisfaction is a complex knot of personal feelings, economic realities, tech usage, and societal structures. Perhaps eliminating it is unrealistic; learning to navigate it better might be the key.

Maybe the most radical act is consciously questioning the status quo: our definitions of success, work structures, tech relationships, and what constitutes a fulfilling life. Instead of waiting for external definitions, let's take charge and reflect. We can experiment in our own lives, dare to live a little differently, and focus on genuine meaning over external validation or material wealth. Perhaps this collective 'meh' isn't just a symptom, but a catalyst – a wake-up call to build something more meaningful.

*Note: Much of this might have sounded familiar, like a broken record. And you might have read interesting versions of the same ideas elsewhere. But I felt the need to write it down, only to get it out of my head. Apologies!!*
